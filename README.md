# spatial_db
No DB set up. Pure frontend web application. Enables user to view crowd simulations with leaflet map API and also to draw and edit objects (e.g. polylines, polygons) and plot markers on the map. Drawn objects can subsequently be saved as a GeoJSON into a text file. GeoJSON files can be uploaded to be displayed on the map itself. GeoJSON validation included.

# Note
Design of web app is mobile, iPad and desktop responsive.
